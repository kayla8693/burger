# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description
This application is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. The user submits the burger and it appears in the left column, or the "waiting area", along with a "Devour it!" button. Clicking the devour button moves the burger to the right side of the page. Each burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not! 
The application utilizes MySQL, Node, and Express to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML. It also uses a homemade ORM and follows the MVC design pattern.
